# PrefixSpan Implementation in Apache Flink

PrefixSpan is a frequent pattern mining algorithm described in [Pei et al., Mining Sequential Patterns by Pattern-Growth: The PrefixSpan Approach](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1339268/?reload=true).

This repository is adapted/forked from a project did by Tianlong and [Jens](https://github.com/sneJ-) in a course from Professor Volker Markl's group [DIMA](http://www.dima.tu-berlin.de/menue/fachgebiet_datenbanksysteme_und_informationsmanagement/parameter/en/) at TU Berlin. The project is to implement PrefixSpan algorithm in [Apach Flink](https://flink.apache.org/), tune the cluster, and compare the result against [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/mllib-frequent-pattern-mining.html#prefixspan).
